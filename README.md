# ðŸš€SpaceXMontor

_This is an experimental project and it's not endorsed or supported by any company._
I generated this project with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## In a nutshell...
The app gives you information about Past and Future Space Missions and Launches and everything you need to know about this. The product is in continous development and you will see a lot of additional changes as time goes by.

Welcome and have fun ðŸ¤– ðŸš€.


## To Run it in your Development server

Clone the project and run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
